This project explores sentiment analysis of Amazon Fine Food Reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like TextBlob, VADER, and RoBERTa. The main objective was to enhance the accuracy of sentiment detection beyond traditional binary outcomes, enabling a richer understanding of customer feedback. The approach involves employing each NLP tool to interpret and classify sentiments within a vast dataset of online food reviews, aiming for detailed sentiment scores to include sarcasm and colloquialisms.
TextBlob provided a quick and basic analysis, suitable for high-speed processing with minimal data requirements. VADER excelled in real-time applications, effectively interpreting informal language prevalent in customer feedback. RoBERTa, employing deep learning techniques, offered advanced contextual analysis by understanding complex sentence structures and sentiments. The comparative analysis of these models against traditional ML techniques highlighted the superiority of NLP-focused methods in extracting meaningful insights from textual data.The key finding of this study is that NLP tools like RoBERTa significantly outperform simpler sentiment analysis models, providing businesses with deep, actionable insights into consumer behavior. This project underscores the potential of NLP to transform e-commerce strategies by leveraging detailed customer sentiment analysis.
